# Who are you?

Introduce yourselves to TWO other people

# Key Elements of the course

- Rmarkdown
- Github
- RStudio

---

# The bad news

- There are times when learning this material might be 
  frustrating, and that is a totally normal thing, and expected
- funny image
---

# The good news: 

- This is usually temporary and well worth the effort. We are also here to help!

# Why RMarkdown + GitHub?

- Discuss the elements of the video, and what we are going to be focussing on
in  this workshop of that:

# An RMarkdown document

- Example

--

- YAML
- Code Chunks
- Markdown

??? 

- Drop them in the deep end, show them a document with a lot of bells and whistles, describe all of the really useful things in the document
- but then say WAIIIIT
- You've skipped ahead - where are we, what is this place?
- Let's take it back a notch, and work through these pieces step by step.

# How is rmarkdown designed to be used?

As Hadley said^[1] - Rmarkdown:

1.  Communicate with decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions,
    not the code behind the analysis.
    
1.  An environment in which to _do_ data science, to capture the rich
    narrative around your code as a modern day lab 
    notebook, where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you
    were thinking.
    
1.  For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who
    are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e.
    the code).

# Key compenents of an rmarkdown doc?

??? 

show the first example rmarkdown document

  - YAML
  - chunks
  - markdown

---

# What does rmarkdown look like in RStudio?

- Example

???
  - how to run each chunk
  - how to run the whole document
  - How does the formatting of markdown work?
  - shortcuts for creating chunks

---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Your Turn: 

Create rmarkdown document

add some code
make your own little report, copy the text from ...., then add:
bulleted list
numbered list
quote
    
---

# OK, but what if we want to control the output of the document?

.pull-left[

- Code chunks have options


    ```{r tidy=FALSE}
    ```
    
```
]


???

  - demonstrate:
    - echo
    - eval
    - dev
    - error
    - fig.width
    - fig.height
    ...
    - include
    - results
    - message
    
---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Your Turn
   + change the fig.width, fig.height, and dev of the figure
   + print only some of the code
   + print an error message

---

# Tables, inline code, Equations

???

- Table (kable)
- inline code
- equations

---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Your Turn
  - Make a table
  - Make some inline code chunks
  - Make an equation

---

# Setting global options 

???

  - Setting all of these options can be a bit annoying - but there is a better way

---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Your turn

- set a global option to: 
  - hide all of the code
  - dev set

---

# how to troubleshoot an Rmarkdown document

???
  - recreate the session in an interactive session:
    - restart R
    - run all chunks
    - explore working directory issues

---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Your turn

- demonstrate this
    + get everyone to debug a document with a bug in it

---
  
# Using citations in a document

- bibliographies and citations

---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Your turn
  + make bibliographies
  
---

# Recommended workflow for working with rmarkdown

---

# Advanced RMarkdown

---

# Caching

???
  - Why would you want to cache?
  - Show example of a result to cache
  - Show an example of data that can change
  
---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Your Turn:
  + describe a network of chunks so that certain chunks evaluate in an order


---

# learning more:

  - html floating tables
  - PDF and LaTeX output
  - slides (demonstrate that I have these slides)
  - parameters
  - other formats (word, latex, html)
  - csl (to change the citation style)
  - flexdashboard
  - interactive components
  - blogdown
  - bookdown
  - prettydoc
  - rticles
  - How to go from an RScript to Rmd
- where to learn more
- cheatsheets
- some sort of transcript

# What do we expect / hope people to be able to do at the end of the course?

- rmarkdown creates a narrative around the code that you write. Initially, you had to render the rmarkdown document to view the plot or view it in the finder
        - rmarkdown notebooks change that, and provide:
            - data viewer
            - plot view
            - interactive plot usage

- Obvious benefits of this approach:
    - easier to reproduce from start to finish
    - easier to SEE what you are doing and subsequently iterate on that idea
    - handles code printing
    - handles table printing
    - handles pot output
    - equations
    - references
