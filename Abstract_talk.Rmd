## Thomas Gerds: Sensitivity analysis using lava simulation

In this talk I will introduce the simulation functions of the
R-package lava (Klaus K Holst, 2006-2017,
https://github.com/kkholst/lava). I will demonstrate how to utilize
these tools to perform a sensitivity analysis for a given regression
analysis. The first step is to simulate data that are alike the real
data under the substantive model which was fitted to the real data for
the original regression analysis. To do this we specify a structural
equation model for the joint distribution of all variables; in
addition to the substantive model which describes the relation between
outcome and predictors, this requires parametric models for the
interrelationships of the predictor variables. Simulated data under
the so obtained system of structural equations should be alike the
real data. The second step is then to introduce various deviations
from the substantive model in order to study the robustness of the
results found in the real data. Which deviations are of particular
interest depends very much on the subject matter question and are
difficult to discuss in great generality. For the sole purpose of
illustration I will simulate data that are alike the pbc data of the
survival package, and study the sensitivity of a Cox regression
analysis to the existence of an unobserved confounder.

## Farouk Nathoo: Bayesian Group-Sparse Multi-Task Regression for Imaging Genetics

Recent advances in technology for brain imaging and high-throughput genotyping have motivated studies examining the influence of genetic variation on brain structure. In this setting, high-dimensional regression for multi-SNP association analysis is challenging as the response variables obtained through brain imaging comprise potentially interlinked endophenotypes, and there is a desire to incorporate a biological group structure among SNPs based on their genetic arrangement. We consider a recently developed approach for the analysis of imaging genetic studies based on penalized regression with regularization based on a group $l_{2,1}$-norm penalty which encourages sparsity at both the gene and SNP level. While incorporating a number of useful features, a shortcoming of the proposed approach is that it only furnishes a point estimate and techniques for obtaining valid standard errors or interval estimates are not provided. We solve this problem by developing a corresponding Bayesian formulation based on a three-level hierarchical model that allows for full posterior inference using Gibbs sampling. Techniques for the selection of tuning parameters are investigated thoroughly and we make comparisons between cross-validation, fully Bayes, and empirical Bayes approaches for the choice of tuning parameters. Our proposed methodology is investigated using simulation studies and is applied to the analysis of a large dataset collected as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. I will discuss how our MCMC algorithm scales with an increasing number of SNPs, imaging phenotypes, and subjects, and I will also describe extensions of the model for application to brain-wide data and the corresponding development of a spatial model that is currently in progress. Finally, I will introduce the R package ‘bgsmtr’ that implements our model.


## Julie Bertrand: Approche Bayésienne en pharmacogénétique avec JAGS et RStan

### Résumé
Les modèles non linéaires à effets mixtes (MNLEM) utilisent les connaissances a priori sur le médicament pour mieux quantifier la réponse moyenne et sa variabilité intra et inter-patient. Leur développement en pharmacogénétique (PG) devrait permettre d’augmenter la puissance de détection des marqueurs génétiques de la variabilité inter-patient.
Pour estimer les paramètres de ces MNLEM, l’approche par maximum de vraisemblance, principalement utilisée en pharmacologie quantitative est mise en défaut dans les études PG de criblage à haut débit ou N<<p. Dans ce cadre, nous explorons une approche de régression pénalisée (extension de type LASSO dans saemix [1]) puis des approches Bayésiennes (JAGs [2] et RStan [3]) par une étude de simulation et sur les données de l’essai PECAN ANRS 12154 [4].

### Abstract
Nonlinear mixed effect models use the a priori knowledge on the drug to better quantify its average response, intra and inter variability. Their development in pharmacogenetics (PG) is expected to increase the power of detecting the genetic markers of the interpatient variability.
The maximum likelihood approach, commonly used in quantitative pharmacology, fail to estimate these model parameters in high throughput PG studies where N<<p. In that context, we explore a penalized regression (LASSO extension to saemix [1] and Bayesian approaches through a simulation study and on real data from the PECAN ANRS 12154 trial [4].
