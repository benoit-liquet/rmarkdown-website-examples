## Thomas Gerds: Sensitivity analysis using lava simulation

In this talk I will introduce the simulation functions of the
R-package lava (Klaus K Holst, 2006-2017,
https://github.com/kkholst/lava). I will demonstrate how to utilize
these tools to perform a sensitivity analysis for a given regression
analysis. The first step is to simulate data that are alike the real
data under the substantive model which was fitted to the real data for
the original regression analysis. To do this we specify a structural
equation model for the joint distribution of all variables; in
addition to the substantive model which describes the relation between
outcome and predictors, this requires parametric models for the
interrelationships of the predictor variables. Simulated data under
the so obtained system of structural equations should be alike the
real data. The second step is then to introduce various deviations
from the substantive model in order to study the robustness of the
results found in the real data. Which deviations are of particular
interest depends very much on the subject matter question and are
difficult to discuss in great generality. For the sole purpose of
illustration I will simulate data that are alike the pbc data of the
survival package, and study the sensitivity of a Cox regression
analysis to the existence of an unobserved confounder.
